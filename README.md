# Plotting-Tools
 Some python plotting functions I created during my PhD, and which might be useful to others.

 Examples: 
    --plot_histogram can process 100 million points in 3 seconds (seaborn is 15x slower).

    --RealTimePlotting: can be used to render videos (but the framerate is obviously limited).

    --RealTimePlotting_Graph: efficiently update the content of graphs
